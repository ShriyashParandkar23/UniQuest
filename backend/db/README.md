# SQLite database directory
# This directory is created to store SQLite database files
# The actual database files are excluded from version control via .gitignore

# You can place your database files here:
# - db.sqlite3 (development)
# - db_production.sqlite3 (production)
# - db_test.sqlite3 (testing)

# This file ensures the directory exists in the repository
